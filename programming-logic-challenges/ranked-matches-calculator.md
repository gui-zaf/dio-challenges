If victories are less than 10 = Iron
If victories are between 11 and 20 = Bronze
If victories are between 21 and 50 = Silver
If victories are between 51 and 80 = Gold
If victories are between 81 and 90 = Diamond
If victories are between 91 and 100 = Legendary
If victories are greater than or equal to 101 = Immortal

## Output

At the end, a message should be displayed:
"The Hero has a balance of {winBalance} and is at the level of {level}."
